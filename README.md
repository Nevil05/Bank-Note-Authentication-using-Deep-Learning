# Bank-Note-Authentication-using-Deep-Learning

In this project I have classified notes as original (1) or Duplicate (0) on the basis of different feature (Variance, Skewness, Curtosis, Entropy).
We will be using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, tensorflow, scikit-learn.
First, we clean our data (remove outliers) then we train the models, predict the class and then check accuracy of our models.
The main goal of the project is to create an accurate deep learning model that can classify the bank note using the given data where the score of the deep learning model is 1.0
The Dataset used is mentioned!
